### Introduction 

After the application is tested successfully in development,  the application can be move to SIT environment.  In this workshop, both development and SIT environment are in the same openshift cluster.   You can use the steps in the exercise to deploy the same application into next environment (SIT). 

### Tag the application image and deploy the same application into SIT. 

* Go back to **Terminal** tab if you are not in **Terminal** tab.

* To allow %username%-sit to reference images in %username%-dev, bind a service account in %username%-sit to the system:image-puller role in %username%-dev. Execute the 1st command to make sure we are in the correct project.    

```execute
oc project %username%-dev
```

```execute
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:%username%-sit:default -n %username%-dev
```
* Click on **console**.   Switch to **Administration**. Make sure that the project is %username%-sit.  Click on **Builds** -> **ImageStreams**.  It is empty now. 

* Go back to **Terminal** tab.   Tag the application image in DEV to SIT. 

```execute
oc tag -n %username%-dev sampledotnet:latest %username%-sit/sampledotnet:sit
```

* Click on **console**.  Click on the `sampledotnet` and scroll to the bottom.   You will see the image tagged as sampledotnet:sit.

* Go back to **Terminal** tab.   Next step is to deploy the same application into SIT and expose to external. 

```execute
oc project %username%-sit
```

```execute
oc new-app --image-stream=sampledotnet:sit
```

```execute
oc expose service/sampledotnet
```

* The application is deployed successfully.   You can access it via the router.   Click on the **Console** tab.  Switch to **Administration**.   Click on **Networking** -> **Routes**.

* Click on the URL to launch the application.   You will see the same application.

### Summary

In this exercise,  you have learned to tag the same application image to be ready to deploy in SIT and deploy the same application based on that.
