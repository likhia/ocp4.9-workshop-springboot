### Overview

The workshop is intended for developerto get hands-on experience to implement spring boot application, deploy and manage the applications on Openshift.

The following are the features that are covered in this workshop.

* Develop Spring Boot services using CodeReady Workspace.
  * Integrate with another microservice.
  * Integrate with MySQL database

* Use different ways to deploy applications on openshift.
  * Via CodeReady Workspace
  * Via CLI
  * Via Developer Console 

* Create pipeline with Jenkins 

* RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

* Monitoring and Logging 

* Resource Management to manage the resources (CPU, Memory) per project

### Agenda

* Openshift Overview (30 mins)
* Hands On Exercise (120 mins)
  * Exercise 1: Explore Developer Console
  * Exercise 2: Develop and Deploy Spring Boot Microservices using CodeReady Workspace
  * Exercise 3: Services Integration
  * Exercise 4: DB Integration and Dynamics Parameters
  * Exercise 5: Application deployment to next environment
  * Exercise 6: A/B Deployment
  * Exercise 7: Monitoring Logging
  * Exercise 8: Resource Management
* Lunch Break: 1 hour
* Walkthrough with Q&A: 90 mins
  * With some foundation through the hands-on exercises, we will then be doing a walkthrough with the audience on a live application that based on microservice architecture built and deployed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The audience will learn how a new feature can be added with minimum impact to users, using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh to manage traffic flows and scaling the workload with Red Hat OpenShift Serverless together with Red Hat AMQ streams for event streaming. We encourage question and answer anytime during this walkthrough to allow the audience to better appreciate the technology.
